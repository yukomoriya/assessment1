There was a little boy who just celebrated his birthday. His parents bought him a puppy as a birthday present. The puppy had very long ears.

One evening, he was playing with his puppy. The puppy was happily jumping about and wagging his tail. Then the little boy tried to tie the puppy’s ears into a knot. The puppy stopped wagging his tail.

The little boy then tried to tie the puppy’s ears into a bow. The boy chuckled but the puppy became quiet.

“Can you throw your ears over your shoulders like a regimental soldier?" asked the boy. The puppy put his head on the ground and whimpered. The little boy laughed and hugged the puppy. The puppy wagged his tail happily.
